  Summary:
    C: network multi-player real-time strategy game engine
  Description:
    C: >-
      <p>Glest is a network multi-player real-time strategy game
          engine. It includes several
          factions, each one consisting of many 3d characters. The factions
          are loosely based on historical empires with added elements of
          fantasy, such as mummies produced by Egyptian priests, shamans who summon thunderbirds for air assaults, and Norsemen
      who
          can build flying valkries and &quot;Thors&quot;. Start the game by harvesting
          natural resources, then use the cash to produce an army.
          Single-player mode against the CPU is also available.</p>
