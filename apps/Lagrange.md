  Summary:
    C: A Beautiful Gemini Client
  Description:
    C: "<p>Lagrange is a desktop GUI client for browsing Geminispace. \n            It offers modern conveniences familiar from
      web browsers, \n            such as smooth scrolling, inline image viewing, multiple \n            tabs, visual themes,
      Unicode fonts, bookmarks, history, and\n            page outlines.</p>\n<p>Like the Gemini protocol, Lagrange has been
      designed with\n            minimalism in mind. It depends on a small number of essential\n            libraries. It is
      written in C and uses SDL for \n            hardware-accelerated graphics. OpenSSL is used for secure\n            communications.</p>"

                                positioned. You may find that adjusting the UI scale factor
                                (Preferences &gt; Interface) is necessary after upgrading.</li>
          <li>Sidebar width changing when moving the window to a different
