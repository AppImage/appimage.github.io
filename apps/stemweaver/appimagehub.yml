  StemWeaver is a professional audio stem separation tool that uses advanced AI models to extract individual instruments from audio files.
  
  Key features:
  - Multiple AI models (Demucs, MDX, VR networks)
  - Support for 4-stem and 6-stem separation
  - GPU acceleration with CUDA
  - Batch processing capabilities
  - MIDI export for melodic instruments
  - Post-processing denoising
  - Modern, intuitive GUI
  
  The AppImage is built using GitHub Actions and includes all necessary dependencies.
  
  First-time users will need to download AI models (~1-2GB) on first run, which requires an internet connection.
