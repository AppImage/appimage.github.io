# Need to handle multiple AppImages per release for this? (to be decided)
# We also need to think about how we handle multiple architectures... perhaps we should only care about x86_64 and 
# since we link to the download page, the user could download other architectures from there?
# But at least we should somehow carry the information that downloads for multiple architectures are available.
