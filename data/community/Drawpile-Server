# This AppImage is for operating Drawpile in headless server mode.
# Drawpile is a Free/Libre networked drawing program that allows multiple people to sketch on the same image simultaneously.
# It supports the OpenRaster image file format and thus works well with applications such as MyPaint, Krita and GIMP.
