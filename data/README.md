This is the directory that new AppImages should be submitted to.

If you are the developer of an AppImage or are certain that the AppImage you
want to add is official (eg: straight from the official website) it should be
added under `official`. If you want to add a community-maintained AppImage, it
must be added under `community`.

Add a single file with the name of the application and inside that file add a
single line, either pointing to a direct download to the AppImage, or to a
GitHub page that hosts it under its releases.
