		<p>
		Eternal Lands is a free 3D fantasy MMORPG (massively multiplayer online
		role playing game) that can be played on Windows, Android, Linux and
		OSX.
		</p>
		<p>
		There are 12 skills in the game: Attack, Defense, Harvest, Alchemy,
		Magic, Potion, Summoning, Manufacturing, Crafting, Engineering,
		Tailoring and Ranging.  There are no fixed class restrictions, so you
		can develop your character in any way you wish.
		</p>
		<p>
		You, as a player, determine exactly how you develop your character. If
		you make mistakes, or decide to change or adjust your build, you can do
		so.  Eternal Lands is not just about combat. Many players focus on more
		peaceful activities such as collecting resources, creating items,
		summoning monsters and so on. But if you like combat, there is plenty
		of it as well, both PvP and PvE.
		</p>
		<p>
		Eternal Lands is owned and run by Radu Privantu. This package is built
		and maintained by one of the client developers known in game as bluap.
