    <p>
      lux is a viewer for &apos;ordinary&apos; images, panoramas and panorama specifications in PTO format. The view can be zoomed, panned, rotated, made brighter/darker etc. It supports a wide range of image formats, like JPG, PNG, TIFF and openEXR - image I/O is done with libvigraimpex. It supports &apos;flat&apos; images and several panoramic projections: spherical, cylindrical, stereographic, fisheye and rectilinear, both for the image and the view. For images made with a camera or smartphone which have appropriate metadata, lux will show a perspective-corrected view - lux uses libexiv2. lux  can also stitch panoramas, and fuse or HDR-merge exposure brackets specified in a PTO file made with, e.g., hugin. It can not do image registration. What&apos;s seen on-screen can be exported as a &apos;snapshot&apos;. lux is also good for slide shows. Many PTO features are supported, including panoramas with stacks. lux provides it&apos;s own implementation of the Burt&amp;Adelson image splining algorithm for seamless stitching and exposure fusion, working directly from the source image set with no intermediate images.
