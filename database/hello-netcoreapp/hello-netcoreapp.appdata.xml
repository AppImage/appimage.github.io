    <p>
      hello-netcoreapp is a basic .NET Core console application that prints "Hello World!". Its source code repository contains additional scripts and files for building the app and creating release artifacts for a framework-dependent deployment (FDD), self-contained deployment (SCD), Docker image, Chocolatey package and AppImage. So the purpose of this app is not the app itself, but to showcase how to build the aforementioned release artifacts.
