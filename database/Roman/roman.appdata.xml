    <p>
      Roman is a program used to build course material for online learning systems (LMS).
      Course material is compiled to LMS configrations and presentation files using Docker
      containers. Roman manages this process. In addition, Roman runs validation step to verify
      that the generated configuration is valid and usable by the LMS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roman has been designed specifically to work with A+ online learning system.
      With A+, course material is written in reStructuredText (RST). Material is compiled
      to html and yaml files using Ariel, a tool build on top of Sphinx that contains
      custom extensions for this purpose. Typical course definition includes Ariel as
      a build step.

    <p>
      Roman requires Docker CE to be installed in your system and you to have access to it.
