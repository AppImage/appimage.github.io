	<summary>Vifm - Vim-like file manager</summary>

	<description>
		<p>Vifm is a curses based Vim-like file manager extended with some useful ideas from mutt. If you use Vim, Vifm gives you complete keyboard control over your files without having to learn a new set of commands. It goes not just about Vim like keybindings, but also about modes, options, registers, commands and other things you might already like in Vim.</p>
		<p>Just like Vim, Vifm tries to adhere to the Unix philosophy. So instead of working solutions which are set in stone user is provided with a set of means for customization of Vifm to one's likings. Though builtin functionality should be enough for most of use cases.</p>
