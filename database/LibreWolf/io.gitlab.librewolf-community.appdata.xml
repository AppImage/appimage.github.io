    <p>LibreWolf</p>
    <p>This project is an independent fork of Firefox, with the primary goals of privacy security and user freedom. It is the community run successor to LibreFox.</p>
    <p>LibreWolf uses more than 500 privacy/security/performance settings, patches, LibreWolf-Addons (optional) and is designed to minimize data collection and telemetry as much as possible (updater, crashreporter and Firefox’s integrated addons that don’t respect privacy are removed).</p>
    <p>LibreWolf is NOT associated with Mozilla or its products.</p>
    <p>Features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Latest Version of Firefox: LibreWolf is compiled directly from the latest build of Firefox Stable. You will have the the latest features, and security updates.</li>
      <li>Completely Independent Build: LibreWolf uses a completely independent build from Firefox and has its own settings, profile folder and installation path. As a result, it can be installed alongside Firefox or any other browser.</li>
      <li>Settings protection: important settings are enforced/locked within librewolf.cfg and policies.json, those settings cannot be changed by addons/updates/LibreWolf itself or unwanted/accidental manipulation; To change those settings you can easily do it by editing librewolf.cfg and policies.json.</li>
      <li>LibreWolf-addons: set of optional LibreWolf extensions</li>
      <li>Statistics disabled: telemetry and similar functions are disabled</li>
      <li>Tested settings: settings are performance aware</li>
      <li>Recommended and code reviewed addons list</li>
      <li>Community-Driven</li>
      <li>And much more…</li>
    </ul>
