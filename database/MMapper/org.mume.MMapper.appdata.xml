    <p>
      MMapper is a graphical mapper for a MUD named MUME (Multi-Users in Middle
      Earth). The game is traditionally played in a text-only mode, but MMapper tries
      to represent the virtual world in user-friendly graphical environment. It acts
      as a proxy between a telnet client and a MUD server, being able to analyze game
      data in real time and show player's position in a map.
